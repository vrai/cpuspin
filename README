cpuspin 1.0.0
-------------

The cpuspin tool is simply a tight loop with the occasional time check.
Within this loop a division and sqrt operation is applied to a set of
random numbers. In normal operation this will result in an (uncontended)
CPU core maxing out for the duration of the run.

Details on using the cpuspin tool can be found by running the binary
without any arguments or by viewing the man page.
