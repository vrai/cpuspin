.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBcpuspin\fP tool is simply a tight loop with the occasional time
check. Within this loop a division and \fBsqrt\fP operation is applied
to a set of random numbers. In normal operation this will result in an
(uncontended) CPU core maxing out for the duration of the run.
.sp
Note that exact timing of the run is not guaranteed. Overall machine
load could result in the tool running for slightly longer than the
specified number of seconds.
